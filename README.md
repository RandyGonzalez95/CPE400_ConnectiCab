## Running / Dependencies
All code was tested using Linux 16.04. SDL2 must be installed on the machine using "sudo apt-get install libsdl2-2.0"

## Makefile Instructions
The makefile works as expected and must be updated with new files added in.

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cp ../makefile .
make
./ConnectiCab
```
Alternatively you can run the bash script provided "run.sh" by simply running:

```bash
./run.sh
```
